# 🐳 Complete Docker Guide — Volumes, Run, Networking (Well‑Formatted Edition)

---

# 1️⃣ What Are Docker Volumes?

A **volume** is a persistent storage mechanism managed by Docker.

Containers are ephemeral (temporary). When a container is removed, its internal filesystem is removed too.

Volumes solve this problem.

They allow:

- Data persistence
- Sharing data between containers
- Mounting host folders into containers

---

## 🔹 Types of Storage in Docker

### 1. Anonymous Volume

```bash
docker run -v /data my-app
```

Docker creates a random volume.

---

### 2. Named Volume

```bash
docker volume create my-volume

docker run -v my-volume:/app/data my-app
```

Docker manages storage in:

```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/
```

---

### 3. Bind Mount (Host Folder Mount)

```bash
docker run -v /home/user/project:/workspace my-app
```

This connects a host folder directly into the container.

---

|   |   +-----------------------+   |               |
|   +-------------------------------+               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### 🔥 What This Means

- `/home/user/project` exists on your computer
- `/workspace` exists inside the container
- They point to the SAME physical data
- If you edit file on host → container sees it instantly
- If container modifies file → host sees it instantly

Both see the same data.

# 2️⃣ How `docker run my-app node server.js` Works (No docker exec)

When you run:

```bash
docker run my-app node server.js
```

Docker performs these steps internally:

---

## Step 1: Image Lookup

Docker checks if `my-app` image exists locally.

If not → it pulls from Docker Hub.

---

## Step 2: Container Creation

Docker creates a new isolated container layer on top of the image.

Each container has:

- Its own filesystem
- Its own process namespace
- Its own network namespace
- Its own PID 1 process

---

## Step 3: Filesystem Mounting

Docker:

- Mounts image layers (read-only)
- Adds writable layer on top
- Applies bind mounts or volumes

---

## Step 4: Process Execution

Docker starts:

```
node server.js
```

as PID 1 inside container.

This is NOT using `docker exec`.

`docker exec` is only used to enter an already running container.

---

# 3️⃣ Docker Networking (Full Explanation)

Every container gets its own network namespace.

By default, Docker creates a bridge network called:

```
bridge
```

---

# 🔹 Default Bridge Architecture

```
                 HOST MACHINE

                192.168.1.10

              +----------------+
              |  docker0       |  (Virtual Bridge)
              |  172.17.0.1    |  (Gateway)
              +----------------+
                  │        │
          ---------        ---------
          │                         │
   Container A                Container B
   172.17.0.2                 172.17.0.3
```

---

## 🔥 Important Concepts

### docker0

A virtual network bridge created by Docker.

It acts like a router/switch.

---

### Default Gateway

Inside every container:

```
Default Gateway = 172.17.0.1
```

That is docker0.

When container wants internet:

```
Container → docker0 → Host → Internet
```

---

# 4️⃣ How Containers Communicate

## Case 1: Default Bridge

Containers can communicate using IP addresses:

```
http://172.17.0.3:3000
```

BUT not by container name.

---

## Case 2: User-Defined Bridge (Recommended)

```bash
docker network create my-network

docker run --network my-network --name app1 my-app

docker run --network my-network --name db my-db
```

Now containers can communicate using names:

```
http://db:5432
```

Docker provides internal DNS automatically.

---

# 5️⃣ Port Mapping (Host ↔ Container)

```bash
docker run -p 5000:3000 my-app
```

Means:

```
Host:5000 → Container:3000
```

Flow:

```
Browser → Host:5000 → Docker NAT → Container:3000
```

---

# `docker network create my-network`

## 🔹 Syntax

```
docker network create [OPTIONS] NETWORK_NAME
```

In your case:

```
docker network create my-network
```

### What this means:

- Create a **user-defined bridge network**
- Name it: `my-network`

## 🔥 What Actually Happens Internally

When you create this network, Docker:

### 1. Creates a new virtual Linux bridge

Something like:

```
br-<random_id>
```

You can see it:

```
ip addr
```

Example:

```
br-7d83c9e2c1f4
```

This is similar to `docker0`, but isolated.



### Assigns a new subnet

Docker automatically chooses a subnet like:

```
172.18.0.0/16
```

You can verify:

```
docker network inspect my-network
```

You’ll see:

```
"Subnet": "172.18.0.0/16",
"Gateway": "172.18.0.1"
```

So now:

- Gateway = `172.18.0.1`
- Containers will get IPs like:
  - `172.18.0.2`
  - `172.18.0.3`

# `docker run --network my-network --name app1 my-app`

## 🔹 Syntax

```
docker run 
  --network <network_name>
  --name <container_name>
  <image_name>
```

Your command:

```
docker run --network my-network --name app1 my-app
```

### This means:

- Create a container from image `my-app`
- Attach it to `my-network`
- Give container name: `app1`

## 🔥 What Happens Internally

### Step 1: Container Created

Docker:

- Creates container filesystem
- Sets up namespaces
- Creates writable layer

---

### Step 2: Network Namespace Created

Each container gets its own:

- IP stack
- Routing table
- Loopback interface

### Step 3: Docker Creates veth Pair

This is VERY important.

Docker creates something called a **veth pair**.

Think of it like a virtual ethernet cable.

```
Host Side        Container Side
---------        --------------
vethXYZ  <---->  eth0
```

- One end stays on host
- One end goes inside container

---

### Step 4: Connect to Bridge

The host side of veth connects to:

```
br-7d83c9e2c1f4
```

Now your container is plugged into the virtual switch.

---

### Step 5: Assign IP

Docker assigns:

```
172.18.0.2
```

Inside container:

```
eth0 → 172.18.0.2
Gateway → 172.18.0.1
```



# `docker run --network my-network --name db my-db`

Same process happens.

This container now gets:

```
172.18.0.3
```

Both are on same virtual LAN.

---

#  How Naming Works

This is the most important part.

When you use:

```
--name app1
```

Docker registers this name in its internal DNS server.

Docker runs an embedded DNS server inside each user-defined network.

---

## 🔥 Internal DNS Magic

When `app1` tries to access:

```
http://db:5432
```

Inside container:

1. Container asks: “Who is db?”
2. Docker DNS server checks network registry.
3. Finds container named `db`.
4. Returns IP: `172.18.0.3`.

So:

```
db → 172.18.0.3
```

This ONLY works in **user-defined networks**.

It does NOT work in default `bridge`.

---

#  Full Communication Flow

```
         USER DEFINED NETWORK (my-network)

                 br-xxxxxx
               172.18.0.1 (gateway)
                     │
          ┌──────────┴──────────┐
          ▼                     ▼
     app1 container         db container
     172.18.0.2              172.18.0.3
```

When app1 connects to db:

```
app1 → DNS lookup (db)
     → Docker DNS returns 172.18.0.3
     → Packet sent to 172.18.0.3
     → Bridge forwards to db container
```

No NAT needed (same subnet).

---

#  Default Gateway

Inside each container:

```
ip route
```

You’ll see:

```
default via 172.18.0.1 dev eth0
```

If container wants internet:

```
Container → Gateway (bridge) → Host → Internet
```

Docker performs NAT at host level.

---

# Why This Is Better Than Default Bridge

Default `bridge`:

- No automatic DNS
- Must use IP
- Less isolation

User-defined bridge:

- Automatic DNS
- Container name resolution
- Better isolation
- Cleaner architecture

This is how Docker Compose works internally.

---

#  What Happens When You Remove Container?

If you remove `db`:

```
docker rm db
```

Docker:

- Removes veth pair
- Removes DNS entry
- Frees IP

If you recreate `db`, it may get a new IP.

But name `db` will always work.

---

# Important Production Detail

IP addresses are dynamic.

NEVER use IP like:

```
172.18.0.3
```

Always use:

```
db
```

Because DNS abstracts IP changes.

---

# 🔥 In One Sentence

When you create a user-defined network:

- Docker creates a new isolated virtual LAN
- Containers plugged into it get unique IPs
- Docker runs an internal DNS
- `--name` becomes hostname inside that network
- Containers communicate using names, not IPs
